# Sandwich-Club
This app is made as a part of Udacity [Android Developer Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801)

## Objective

Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for this project will help you to better understand how it is processed.Design the layout for the detail activity so the different elements display in a sensible way. Implement the JSON parsing in JsonUtils so it produces a Sandwich Object that can be used to populate the UI that you designed.
